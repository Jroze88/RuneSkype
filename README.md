#Project Title

##RuneSkype is the newest and best way for you and your friends to interact while playing your favorite Role Playing Game (RPG). In our case that is RuneSkype.




###Getting Started

###Playing RuneSkype is easy, just download a copy from our homepage or our repo:

From there you'l want to intstall React, Node, Express, Firebase, Twilio-Video, Twilio, WebRTC, Axios, and React-Drag. These dependencies will allow you to set up the RuneSkype environment.
